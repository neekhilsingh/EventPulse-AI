# 📖 Overview

Traffic incidents often lead to delayed emergency response, increased congestion, and inefficient resource utilization.

**EventPulse-AI** leverages Machine Learning and intelligent decision support to help traffic authorities:

- Predict incident priority
- Assess operational impact
- Recommend response actions
- Allocate emergency resources
- Identify incident locations using reverse geocoding
- Visualize incidents through an interactive dashboard

Instead of relying solely on manual assessment, EventPulse-AI provides **AI-assisted operational decision support** for faster and more informed responses.

# ✨ Features

## 🤖 Machine Learning Priority Prediction

- Random Forest Classifier
- Predicts High / Low Priority incidents
- Confidence score for every prediction

---

## 🧠 AI Response Recommendation

Generates intelligent response plans including:

Kengeri Main Road,
Ambedkar Circle,
Bengaluru,
Karnataka
```

---

## 🚓 Emergency Resource Allocation

Suggests nearby emergency resources including:

- Police Station
- Hospital
- Fire Station

---

## 📊 Interactive Dashboard

Built using **Streamlit**

Features include:

- Incident Analysis
- Severity Meter
- AI Summary
- Resource Allocation
- Incident Timeline
